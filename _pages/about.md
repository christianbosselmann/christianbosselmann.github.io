Christian is a Neurologist in training at the Department of [Neurology and Epileptology, University Hospital Tübingen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/neurologie) and member of the [Lerche lab "Experimental Epileptology" at the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research](https://www.hih-tuebingen.de/forschung/neurologie-mit-schwerpunkt-epileptologie/), as well as the [Pfeifer lab "Methods in Medical Informatics" at the Department of Computer Science](http://pfeiferlab.org). Christian earned his MD at medical school in Tübingen, Prague and Newcastle upon Tyne. His [thesis](https://repositorium.ixtheo.de/xmlui/handle/10900/80299) was on African sleeping sickness, an infectious neurological disease, which he completed at the Duszenko Lab, Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry (IFIB) Tübingen.

Christian is excited about developing machine-learning based methods for ion channel disorders, in a patient-centered and translational approach - bridging gaps between clinical genetics, electrophysiology and precision medicine. When he is not in the lab, he is probably seeing his patients at the Epilepsy clinic. Here, his focus lies on developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) incl. tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), as well as the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. His expertise in epileptology and electroencephalography has been certified by the German Society for Epileptology (DGfE) and the German Society for Neurophysiology and Functional Imaging (DGKN).

In his free time, you can probably find him on a [Stocherkahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat)#Punting_around_the_world), enjoying a quiet day on the river Neckar.
