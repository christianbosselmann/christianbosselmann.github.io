Christian is a Epilepsy Precision Medicine Research Fellow at the [Charles Shor Epilepsy Center and Genomic Medicine Institute of the Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/depts/epilepsy), working with Dennis Lal. He is excited about developing machine-learning based methods for ion channel disorders and rare epilepsy syndromes, in a patient-centered and translational approach - bridging gaps between clinical genetics, electrophysiology and precision medicine. 

Previously, he was a Clinician-Scientist at the Department of [Neurology and Epileptology, University Hospital Tübingen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/neurologie) and member of the [Lerche lab "Experimental Epileptology" at the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research](https://www.hih-tuebingen.de/forschung/neurologie-mit-schwerpunkt-epileptologie/), as well as the [Pfeifer lab "Methods in Medical Informatics" at the Department of Computer Science](http://pfeiferlab.org). When he is not in the lab, he is probably seeing his patients at the Epilepsy clinic. Here, his focus lies on developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) incl. tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), as well as the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. His expertise in epileptology and electroencephalography has been certified by the German Society for Epileptology (DGfE) and the German Society for Neurophysiology and Functional Imaging (DGKN).

Christian went to medical school in Tübingen, Prague, and Newcastle upon Tyne. His [thesis](https://repositorium.ixtheo.de/xmlui/handle/10900/80299) was on fluorescence and electron microscopy at the blood-brain and blood-csf barrier, which he completed at the Duszenko Lab, Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry (IFIB) Tübingen.

In his free time, you can probably find him with a good [book](https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_aurelius-meditations/1916/pb_LCL058.3.xml) or on a [Stocherkahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat)#Punting_around_the_world), enjoying a quiet day on the river Neckar.
